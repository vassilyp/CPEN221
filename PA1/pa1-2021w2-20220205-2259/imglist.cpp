* This function is NOT part of the ImgList class,

* Returns the "difference" between two hue values.
* PRE: hue1 is a double between [0,360).
* PRE: hue2 is a double between [0,360).
* 
* The hue difference is the absolute difference between two hues,
* but takes into account differences spanning the 360 value.
* e.g. Two pixels with hues 90 and 110 differ by 20, but
*      two pixels with hues 5 and 355 differ by 10.

* PARAM: rowstart - pointer to the first node in a row
* PARAM: selectionmode - criterion used for choosing the node to return
*          0: minimum luminance across row, not including extreme left or right nodes
*          1: node with minimum total of "hue difference" with its left neighbour and with its right neighbour.

* A note about "hue difference": For PA1, consider the hue value to be a double in the range [0, 360).
* That is, a hue value of exactly 360 should be converted to 0.
* The hue difference is the absolute difference between two hues,

*          false: render one pixel per node, ignores fillmode
*          true: render the full width of the original image,
*                filling in missing nodes using fillmode
* PARAM: fillmode - specifies how to fill gaps
*          0: solid, uses the same colour as the node at the left of the gap
*          1: solid, using the averaged values (all channels) of the nodes at the left and right of the gap
*             Note that "average" for hue will use the closer of the angular distances,
*             e.g. average of 10 and 350 will be 0, instead of 180.
*             Average of diametric hue values will use the smaller of the two averages
*             e.g. average of 30 and 210 will be 120, and not 300
*                  average of 170 and 350 will be 80, and not 260

*             linear gradient between the colour (all channels) of the nodes at the left and right of the gap

*             a gap of width 2 will be coloured with 1/3 and 2/3 of the difference
*             a gap of width 3 will be coloured with 1/4, 2/4, 3/4 of the difference, etc.
*             Like fillmode 1, use the smaller difference interval for hue,
