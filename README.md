This is a collection of the C++ assignments I worked on for my Algorithms and Data Structures course at UBC.

##PA1

Summary: Developed an algorithm to compress PNG images using doubly-linked lists to represent pixel data.

##PA2

##PA3

Summary: Used PTrees to compress an image by up to 89\% while preserving critical details.

Relevant (and cool) images:
