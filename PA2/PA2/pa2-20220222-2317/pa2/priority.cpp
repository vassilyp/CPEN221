/*
* File:        priority.cpp
* Description: Implements a priority ordering structure specially made for determining the
*              order of neighbours visited in PA2's filler::fill function.
*              Note that this does NOT serve the same purpose as the stack/queue
*              ordering structure which you have also been asked to implement.
*
*              Ignoring resize costs, any single insertion or removal operation
*              should cost at most O(n), where n is the number of PixelPoints
*              stored in the collection.

*  Priority condition:
*    The PixelPoint in the collection whose color is the minimum distance away
*    from the reference color is the priority item to be returned.
*
*    In case of multiple items with the same priority value (i.e. minimal distance
*    away from the reference color), the one with the minimal y-coordinate will be
*    selected.
*    In case of multiple items with the same priority value and the same y-coordinate,

*
*    ***ATTENTION*** The dist() function in HSLAPixel.h will be very helpful!

*  priority order and/or accessing the priority element in this specific application!
